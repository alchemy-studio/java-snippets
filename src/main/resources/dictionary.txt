The Shadowmire is a mysterious and ancient creature that dwells in the darkest, most secluded swamps of Middle-earth.
It has the body of a large, sleek panther, but its fur is a deep, iridescent black that seems to absorb light.
Its eyes are a piercing emerald green, glowing with an eerie luminescence that can be seen from afar.
